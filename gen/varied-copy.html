<h1>Varied Copy</h1>

<p>This is a document that contains a variety of different HTML
elements that might be included in a page on the website.  Its
purpose is to test out how well the site handles all the stuff
that might be thrown at it.  In particular it will test out the
stylesheets.</p>

<p>For example, you are currently reading text put inside
paragraphs.  At the very top is a level one header.</p>

This text here isn't contained within any tags at all.  Hopefully
this should never be encountered because the WYSIWYG editor will
form everything correctly.  But we can't rely upon that.

<p>There are many good reasons to test this out:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an unordered list</li>
<li>comes along, how do we</li
<li>know how well it will display things.  After all, it could
make a complete hash of the whole arrangement and really
embarrass us, and that would never do.  Instead we want it
to look really good, so we need to have prepared.</li>
<li>Which is why this exists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone once said, "It is a good idea to test out the
quoting used on the site."  By 'quoting' we are referring to
the use of quotation marks, and whether they get properly
curlified.  For 'tis a fact of life that they often don't.
And that's true of apostrophes isn't it.</p>

<blockquote>But by quoting we could also mean putting blocks
of text inside block quotations.  You are reading one of those
now.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>But don't forget that block quotes are often just wrappers
around normal paragraphs.  This is a quote like that.  We've
put our text inside paragraphs, and they have gone inside a
blockquote element.</p>
<p>This gives us the freedom to start a new paragraph without
starting a new quotation.  I've just shown an example of that.
This is often seen, although quoters should be careful not to
quote too much, or the readers will lose interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to be able to count on our styles working for us.
And speaking of counting...</p>

<ol>
<li>This is one.</li>
<li>This is two.</li>
<li>This is a third, which drags on a bit, but gives us a
good idea of what happens when things do that.  Sometimes we
need this sort of thing to take place, even when it can be
extremely demanding.</li>
<li>This is four.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which is all well and good, but having just whet your
appetites with the heading at the top of the page I'm sure
you're keen to see more heading action.  I'm happy to oblige.</p>

<h1>A Level-One Heading</h1>

<p>Yes, I know you've already seen this, but it is good for
comparison purposes.  And we need to make sure we're doing this
properly.  So I've put one in.</p>

<h2>A Level-Two Heading</h2>

<p>As the first level of heading is usually reserved for the
heading of the main document then a level two heading is the
one that would be used for major section headings within th
document.</p>

<h3>A Level-Three Heading</h3>

<p>And we continue with a level three heading.  If I'm honest
with you, all these little bits are getting quite tiresome,
but I'm determined to keep putting paragraphs between the
headings so the spacing is more obvious.</p>

<h4>A Level-Four Heading</h4>

<p>I end up using H4s quite a bit.  I think it's because
they usually get rendered in a nice subtle way &ndash; just
a little bit bigger and bolder than normal text.  Which is
all I often need.  Larger headings get so vulgar.</p>

<h5>A Level-Five Heading</h5>

<p>Heading after this point usually start looking a little
bit silly, as they often start looking smaller than the body
text that they're supposed to head up.  And if people are
using this much nesting within their documents they are
going to make it really hard for their readers.</p>

<h6>A Level-Six Heading</h6>

<p>This is as far as a lot of places take their headings.
I've sometimes come across H9s, but I'm not going to do
that here, as it will start getting silly.</p>

<p>But so far we have only covered block-level elements.
Might I be <b>as bold as</b> to suggest that <strong>a
strong idea</strong> would be to test <span>span level
elements</span> too.  Things like <i>the italics that</i>
we often need <em>to emphasise</em> more.</p>

<p>As it would be <strike>a bad idea</strike> a good
idea to test out how <code>the tags that</code> we put
into the code come out.  Otherwise it <u>just underlines
completely</u> the original point.</p>

<p>When we come to <a href="/">the root of</a> the matter
we find we are often left going <a href="#nowhere">nowhere
in particular</a>.  But if we get completely stuck we can
<a href="http://www.google.com">always Google it</a>.

<p>But we are overlooking some other things:</p>

<pre><code>while author in a.technical(mood):
    if codeblocks in the.document:
        display(codeblocks)
    else:
        with a.Shrug():
            raise Shoulders()</code></pre>
